# Book Fortran for Scientists and Engineers

*Sandro Ricardo de Souza*

Repository of code developed while reading the book Fortran for Scientists and Engineers by Stephen J. Chapman.

The code (examples and exercises) is separated by chapter. Executable files (*.x, *.exe) are not uploaded because I will typically generate binaries for different platforms (Linux, Windows, and Mac).

I haven't organized the code within chapters because the code is for educational purposes only.
